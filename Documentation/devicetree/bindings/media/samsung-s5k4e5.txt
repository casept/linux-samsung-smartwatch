* Samsung S5K4E5 Raw Image Sensor

S5K4E5 is a raw image sensor with maximum resolution of 2560x1920
pixels. Data transfer is carried out via MIPI CSI-2 port and controls
via I2C bus.

Required Properties:
- compatible	: should contain "samsung,s5k4e5"
- reg		: I2C device address
- reset-gpios	: specifier of a GPIO connected to the RESET pin
- clocks	: should refer to the clock named in clock-names, from
		  the common clock bindings
- clock-names	: should contain "extclk" entry
- svdda-supply	: core voltage supply
- svddio-supply	: I/O voltage supply

Optional Properties:
- clock-frequency : the frequency at which the "extclk" clock should be
		    configured to operate, in Hz; if this property is not
		    specified default 24 MHz value will be used

The device node should be added to respective control bus controller
(e.g. I2C0) nodes and linked to the csis port node, using the common
video interfaces bindings, defined in video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	i2c-isp@13130000 {
		s5k4e5@20 {
			compatible = "samsung,s5k4e5";
			reg = <0x20>;
			reset-gpios = <&gpx1 2 1>;
			clock-frequency = <24000000>;
			clocks = <&clock 129>;
			clock-names = "extclk"
			svdda-supply = <...>;
			svddio-supply = <...>;
			port {
				is_s5k4e5_ep: endpoint {
					data-lanes = <1 2 3 4>;
					remote-endpoint = <&csis0_ep>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
