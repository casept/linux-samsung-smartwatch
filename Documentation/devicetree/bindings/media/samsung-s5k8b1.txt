Samsung S5K8B1YX raw image sensor
---------------------------------

S5K8B1YX is a raw image sensor with MIPI CSI-2 image data interfaces and CCI
(I2C compatible) control bus.

Required properties:

- compatible	  : "samsung,s5k8b1";
- reg		  : I2C slave address of the sensor;
- vdda-supply	  : analogue power supply (typically 2.8 V);
- vddio-supply	  : digital I/O power supply (typically 1.8 V);
- vddd-supply	  : digital core power supply (typically 1.2 V);
- xshutdown-gpios : specifier of a GPIO connected to the XSHUTDOWN pin;
- clocks	  : should contain the sensor's EXTCLK clock specifier, from
		    the common clock bindings.
- clock-names	  : should contain "extclk" entry;
- data-lanes	  : specifies MIPI CSI-2 data lanes as covered in
		    video-interfaces.txt. The sensor supports up to 2 data
		    lanes.

Optional properties:

- clock-frequency : the frequency at which the "extclk" clock should be
		    configured to operate, in Hz; if this property is not
		    specified default 24 MHz value will be used.

The common video interfaces bindings (see video-interfaces.txt) should be
used to specify link to the image data receiver. The S5K8B1YX device node
should contain one 'port' child node with an 'endpoint' subnode.
